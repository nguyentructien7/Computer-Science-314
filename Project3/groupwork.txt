Project 3 Scheduler

For this project, Tien and I went through and figured the first part out together. We went through the pencil and paper scheduling step by step together. For the second part of the project, my job was to determine what the scheduler needed to do and how it needed to differ from the round robin implementation. I went through and edited what I thought would successfully implement a multilevel feedback queue scheduler inside of ProcessSuspend, ProcessWakeup, and ProcessFork. Then was responsible for determining the crucial information about the priority and how it needed to be recalculated. We put this together and Tien worked on the fine tuning to be sure that the scheduler worked as expected. From what we can tell, there are no issues with our implementation. It might have been easier if we worked on the entire thing together at all times because this project took us a long time to complete. We compared the overheads together of the two schedulers and were content with our results.
