To begin this project, I first set up DLXOS. Next, I added a new trap vector in traps.h for GetPID.Then I added a trap interface in usertraps.s for the trap vector that was created for GetPID. I noticed that in process.c/ProcessFork the PID is calculated using currentPCB - pcbs. At first, I tried to access the array pcbs in traps.c by making it global in process.c and visible in traps.h but for some reason it did not work correctly, so my next option was to create a function retrievePID inside process.c that uses currentPCB-pcbs to accurately calculate the PID. Next, the function is defined in traps.h called inside of traps.c. There is still an issue with the code because when I execute, there are errors I am unfamiliar with. I also utilized ProcessSetResult to return the PID from the kernel. When the user calls getPID(), the architecture simulator will execute the trap instruction and transfer the control to intrhandler in dlxos.s. Then once the trap handler is created, we are in kernel mode and the value of PID gets returned.
